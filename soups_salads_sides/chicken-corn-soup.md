## Cooking instruction
1. Use the chicken stock & chicken from the previous recipe.
2. Combine in a large saucepan the reserved chicken stock, creamed corn, finely chopped ginger, salt, pepper and chopped shallots, and bring to boil.
3. Mix corn flour in a cup with some water to get a smooth paste. Add to soup and stir until soup boils and thickens. Bring to simmer. 
4. Lightly beat egg whites (1 at a time) in a cup with a little bit of water.  Add to soup in a thin stream. I usually stir the soup just before adding the egg whites.
5. Add thinly stripped chicken meat & shredded ham & heat gently.  Top with extra shallots.
