# Gnocchi

## Ingredients

* 1 large Potato
* 1 egg
* 1 cup continental flour
* Salt & pepper

## Cooking instruction

1. Boil potato, skin on – apparently keeps flavor and minerals in.  Let cool.
2. Add 1 cup flour to bench and make a well in the middle.
3. Lightly beat 1 egg.
4. Peel potato with fingers.  Keep as much good flesh as this is where the flavour is. Put potato in the middle of the well.
5. Pound with left hand, softly flatten and make well.
6. Add beaten egg to well.
7. Work ingredients from center to outside lightly. Don’t go too hard as gnocchi will become too dense. \(light and fluffy is we want\).
8. Roll into a 2-3 cm roll depending on how big you want the gnocchi.
9. Cut into 2-3 cm pieces, mold to an oval and place a fork indent.
10. Wah Laaa. \(good to freeze\)
